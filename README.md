# UFOs
## Overview of the project:
Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstraping I developed a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and that can be used to show and filter a dataset regarding UFO sightings. The dataset can be filtered based of 5 different criteria: Date, City, State, Country and UFO Shape. 

The dataset file is located in the js folder under the name of 'data.js'
