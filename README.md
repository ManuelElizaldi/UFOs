# UFOs
## Overview of the project:
Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstraping I developed a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and that can be used to show and filter a dataset regarding UFO sightings. The dataset can be filtered based of 5 different criteria: Date, City, State, Country and UFO Shape. 

The dataset file is located in the js folder under the name of 'data.js'


### Results:

## Summary on how to use the application:
You can filter this UFO sightings dataset within five different criteria. Once you enter your desired search criteria, information will be shown in the dynamic table. 

Steps to perform a search using this website:
1. Download/clone this repository in your computer.

2. Open the index.html file.

3. enter the desired criteria in the Filter Search input boxes.

4. Read the results in the table.


### Drawback of this webpage
1.The dataset has little variety. The dataset is limited to the country of United States during the year of 2010.

### two additional recommendations for further development
1.The data set can be expanded to include more sightings from other countries and years.
